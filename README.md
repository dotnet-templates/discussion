# Repository templates to quickly bootstrap your next .NET project

GitHub recently announced [Repository Templates](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) which let you clone a repository without bringing along its history. This can be used to quickly get a new project/repostory setup with things like your `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, project layout, etc.

If you have a template you'd like to add, or would like to request a new one, [open an issue](https://github.com/dotnet-templates/discussion/issues/new) to get started.
